About Me

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, where I document my work in cyber threat intelligence, security research, and hands-on learning. My background includes cybersecurity, intelligence, and threat detection, and I am currently expanding my expertise in Splunk  and security automation.

This repository will serve as a place to:

    Share research and notes on cyber threat intelligence
    Document SIEM and endpoint detection use cases
    Explore automation and detection engineering
    Contribute to open-source security projects

Current Goals

    Set up a Splunk test environment
    Develop Python scripts for automating threat intelligence workflows
    Contribute to open-source threat intelligence projects

Planned Content

As I build out my portfolio, this repository will include:

    Threat intelligence reports and security research
    Sigma and YARA detection rules
    Splunk dashboards and search queries
    Python scripts for security automation

Next Steps

I am currently setting up my GitHub workflow, so expect updates soon. If you work in cybersecurity, threat intelligence, or security operations, feel free to connect or collaborate.
